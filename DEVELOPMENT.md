# Development Process

This document outlines the step-by-step process we followed to build the Game of Life simulator. Made using Windsurf and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, 6 December 2024

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. Created basic project structure
2. Set up Express server (server.js)
3. Created initial HTML template with grid layout
4. Implemented basic CSS styling

## Phase 2: Core Game Logic
1. Implemented the Game of Life rules:
   - Cell survival/death conditions
   - Neighbor counting
   - Grid wrapping behavior
2. Added core game controls:
   - Start/Stop simulation
   - Clear grid
   - Random cell generation
3. Implemented cell toggling via mouse clicks

## Phase 3: Pattern Library
1. Created vertical scrollable pattern menu
2. Implemented 20 classic Game of Life patterns:
   - Simple patterns (Blinker, Block)
   - Spaceships (Glider, HWSS)
   - Complex patterns (Gosper Gun, Pulsar)
3. Added tooltips with pattern descriptions
4. Implemented pattern selection and placement system

## Phase 4: Population Tracking
1. Integrated Chart.js library
2. Added real-time population counter
3. Implemented dynamic graph updates
4. Created responsive chart layout

## Phase 5: UI/UX Improvements
1. Enhanced button styling and layout
2. Added hover effects and visual feedback
3. Improved pattern menu organization
4. Optimized tooltip positioning
5. Added responsive design elements

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization
1. Optimized grid rendering
2. Improved pattern placement efficiency
3. Enhanced animation smoothness
4. Optimized population tracking updates

## Testing Process
1. Tested all game rules
2. Verified pattern behaviors
3. Checked population tracking accuracy
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing
5. Performance testing with large patterns

## Future Development Plans
1. Add zoom/pan functionality
2. Implement save/load feature
3. Add pattern creation/editing
4. Enhance mobile support
5. Add simulation speed control
